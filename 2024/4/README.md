Today I learned about `std::map`, and also how to add operator functions to a `struct`. I probably could have used a `std::pair` for the `position` too, but I only just learned about that in part 2 of the problem :grin:.

I found the actual question easier than yesterday, but I spent much more time reading the C++ docs.
