Today I wrote my solution in Python first, just to get the "hard part" of writing the algorithm out of the way. I was then able to "translate" this into C++, which I felt was a much less frustrating exercise, and I think I learned just as much. I was faster at resolving C++ bugs as I knew what the state of all my variables _should_ have been at each point. 

As Trevor said, writing in a new programming language feels kind of like writing with your left hand, and I definitely have been feeling that way. I'm trying to express something in a new language, but my vocabulary just isn't there yet, so it's easier to form my thoughts in my "mother tongue" and then translate what I want to say. 

My python code was a bit of a hacky mess, and subsequently my C++ code felt the same way.

I think I'll do this same thing tomorrow as I feel I learned just as much, but got much more pleasure out of doing the problem.
